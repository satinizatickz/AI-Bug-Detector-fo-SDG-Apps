# üêû AI Bug Detector for SDG Apps

> **AI Bug Detector for SDG Apps** is an intelligent Python-based tool that automatically detects bugs, code smells, and quality issues in software projects aligned with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** ‚Äî such as education, health, and environment applications.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Support SDG Innovation** ‚Äî Encourage developers building impactful SDG solutions by helping them detect and fix bugs early.  
2. **Improve Code Quality** ‚Äî Promote clean, maintainable, and reliable software in AI-driven SDG applications.  
3. **Automate Bug Detection** ‚Äî Provide a lightweight AI-assisted static analysis tool for Python developers.  
4. **Bridge AI and Sustainability** ‚Äî Demonstrate how artificial intelligence can improve sustainable development software practices.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Detects **syntax errors** and structural problems.  
- Flags **missing docstrings** in functions and classes.  
- Identifies **TODO/FIXME** comments to track incomplete work.  
- Detects **long functions** (> 50 lines) as code smell indicators.  
- Generates structured **JSON reports** for easy review.  
- Sector-aware analysis for **Education**, **Health**, and **Environment** projects.

üß† Usage Example

Run the bug detector on a Python file of your choice:

python bug_detector.py --sector education --file path/to/your_script.py

Example Output:

{
  "file": "example.py",
  "sector": "education",
  "issues_detected": 3,
  "issues": [
    "Function 'train_model' is missing a docstring.",
    "Line 42: Found TODO comment.",
    "Function 'process_data' is too long (72 lines)."
  ]
}

Reports are saved in the reports/bug_reports.json file.
